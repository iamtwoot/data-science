# Data Science

Here are my data analytics related works.\
This is the data science block from "100 days of python bootcamp" course.

## Projects
3. **Data Aggregate and Merge Data With Pandas:** Diving deep into a dataset all about LEGO. Keep learning `pandas` module, combine the `.groupby()` and `.count()` functions to aggregate data, use the `.value_counts()` function, create a scatter plot in Matplotlib, work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys, `.merge()` DataFrames along a particular column, create a bar chart with Matplotlib.\

4. **Resampling and Visualising Time Series:** Learned `.describe()` to quickly see some descriptive statistics at a glance, `.resample()` to make a time-series data comparable to another by changing the periodicity. Looked how to work with `matplotlib.dates` Locators to better style a timeline (e.g., an axis on a chart). Found out how to find the number of NaN values with `.isna().values.sum()`. Also keep learning how to beautify plots more deeply.\
